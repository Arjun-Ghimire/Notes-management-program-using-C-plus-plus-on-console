# Notes-management-program-using-C-plus-plus-on-console
Notes management program using c++ on console. It has features like user authentication, id and password encryption, decryption, user dashboard and custom notes management.

# How to run the code?
Its really very simple to run the code. Clone the repository on your folder, If you are using visual studio code then simply run main.cpp file then the program will run without any problem.

# How it works?
1) First run the code and you can choose option to either login or register a new account

3) Now a new file will be automatically created after account registration is successful that will act as a database which holds the encrypted value of the user registration and another text file will also be created based on users username that will hold the note of user.

8) Now next time when you login to your account then you can view your previous note or overwrite it will your newer notes.


This was my simple and interesting program using c++, We have encryption and decryption algorithm you can also modify the code according to your requirements.
